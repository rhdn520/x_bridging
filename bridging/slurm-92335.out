Running inference with timestep: 549
Interpolating between:
  1: The aroma of fresh coffee filled the small kitchen.
  2: Machine learning is very fun!
Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForMaskedLM: ['bert.pooler.dense.bias', 'bert.pooler.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
